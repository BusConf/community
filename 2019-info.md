The hotel has a (German only sadly) page with travel information: ‪http://www.natuerlich-tagen.de/hotel/lage---anfahrt-kopie‬ - here is a rundown of your options:

### By car:

## Schedule

BusConf will officially open on the 1st of August at 17:00 and end on the 3rd of August at 17:00. If you want to, you can extend your stay until Sunday (more on that below). Whether you spend your extra time running self-organized sessions or just relaxing in the sun is of course up to you! You are welcome to arrive in the late afternoon Thursday. ‪At 19:00‬ we will have dinner together. For those who arrive a bit later there will surely be some leftovers.

### Thursday

- Arrival during late afternoon 
- ‪19:00‬ dinner
- ‪20:30‬ opening and evening activities

### Friday

After breakfast we can start with a full day of open space activities until we all get together in the evening to close the day and plan evening activities.

### Saturday

   Open Space ‪until 17:00‬. Some of you will leave already in the evening. Others stay until the next day

### Sunday

What you do on Sunday is entirely up to you. Remember though that if you do want to stay until Sunday you have to contact the hotel (info@natuerlich-tagen.de) and ask them to change your reservation accordingly! In past years there have always been some people staying an extra night. Use the slack channel or create a ticket on the GitHub repo if you want to find out who is planning to spend the extra night.

## Slack Channel

Our official slack channel is #busconf at ‪https://functionalprogramming.slack.com‬ - If you are not on this slack already you can sign up here: ‪https://fpchat-invite.herokuapp.com‬

## Sessions

At BusConf you, the attendees, make up the programme. You decide what you are going to talk about or what you want to learn. The open space format will provide the platform for that. You can use our slack channel to chat about what topics you are really interested in and what you would like to share or learn! So join #busconf on ‪functionalprogramming.slack.com‬ and let's chat!

## Things to bring

We expect the weather to be great so bring summer clothing for outdoor sessions and some sun blocker! You will most certainly want to bring your laptop. Also remember to bring power socket adapters if you are from abroad. Maybe you like to go for a run in the morning? Bring your sports clothing! Maybe some of you play instruments or like to play board games? Just bring your things and lets have an awesome time together.

## Food 

Food is included in your ticket price. During meals water is provided for free.

## Payment

On arrival you will check in at the hotel. You will pay for your stay at the reception of the hotel when you are leaving.

## Projectors

While the venue does offer projectors they tend to be of subpar quality and cost too much. Last year we didn’t have to resort to them because several attendees were able to bring projectors with them. If you are able to bring one, please leave a comment in the projectors issue:
